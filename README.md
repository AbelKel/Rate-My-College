## Overview
### Description

One of the reasons I found this project appealing is that the college application process can often be complicated and finding a good fit college can be challenging. The app aims to help high school juniors and seniors easily find a good fit college. I aim to use CollegeAI API, Google Maps API, and databases such as JSON files. One of the core features of the project is the student to college matching process. This feature aims to minimize the number of hours students spend looking for a college that fits their personality and academic needs or aspirations.

Rate My College is a college review and matching app for students applying to colleges. The first time a user launches the app, they will be prompted to complete a short survey in which they will answer a couple of questions to find a college they might be interested in. Afterwards, the user will be taken to a page where they can see their top 5/10 recommended choices.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Socail/Communication
- **Mobile:** It is a mobile app that students can use to find a good fit college. They can use it to search, view details, and read about colleges.
- **Story:** The app is aimed at making the college search eaiser for students by narrowing down the list of colleges they have to look at. 
- **Market:** Students applying to college 
- **Habit:**  One time/Seasonal Use. The usual college application season is from August until the end of January. This is the time that the app expects a large number of users.
- **Scope:** It is aimed at students that are high school seniors that are applying to college. However, anyone applying to college can use the app.
